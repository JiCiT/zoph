Zoph 0.8.2 to 0.8.3
    * You can use these instructions to go from 0.8.2.1 to 0.8.3
    * If you want to upgrade from 0.8.1, first follow the upgrade instructions from 0.8.1 to 0.8.2
    * If you want to upgrade from an older version, such as 0.8 or 0.8.0.x, first follow the upgrade instructions from 0.8 to 0.8.1, then the upgrade instructions from 0.8.1 to 0.8.2 and finally these instructions.
    * If you're upgrading from an older version, it is not necessary to install the "in between" versions first, you can just install the current version and follow the upgrade instructions below.

Copy the contents of the php directory, including all subdirs, into your webroot and copy the lang directory into the webroot as well. You should make a backup copy of config.inc.php to prevent overwriting it.

	cp config.inc.php config.local.php
	cp -a php/* /var/www/html/zoph
	cp -a lang /var/www/html/zoph

Database changes

Because 0.8.3 is a version "in between" 0.8 and 0.9, you will need to edit the update script. You should comment out the changes that have already been applied to your system. Prepend the changes for 0.8.1 with a "#". There were no database changes in 0.8.2. Execute zoph-update-0.9.sql:

	mysql -u zoph_admin -p zoph < sql/zoph_update-0.9.sql



Zoph 0.8.1 to 0.8.2

 * You can use these instructions to go from 0.8.1.x to 0.8.2
 * If you want to upgrade from 0.8 or 0.8.0.x, first follow the upgrade instructions from 0.8 to 0.8.1 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Zoph/Upgrading#Zoph_0.8_to_0.8.1]

As of 0.8.1, the bin and man directories in the Zoph tarball have been replaced by the cli directory. Also, zophExport.pl no longer exists and zophImport.pl has been replaced by zoph. If you had them installed, you should remove them from your system, they are no longer supported. Don't forget to remove the manpages (zophImport.pl.1.gz and zophExport.pl.1.gz) as well, they will usually be in /usr/share/man/man1.

Copy the contents of the php directory into your webroot and copy the lang directory into the webroot as well. You should make a backup copy of config.inc.php to prevent overwriting it.

	cp config.inc.php config.local.php
	cp -a php/* /var/www/html/zoph
	cp -a lang /var/www/html/zoph


Copy cli/zoph into /bin (or another directory in your $PATH).

	cp cli/zoph /bin

Copy zoph.1.gz into your man 1 directory (usually /usr/share/man/man1) and zoph.ini.5.gz into man 5 (usually /usr/share/man/man5).

	cp cli/zoph.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1
	cp cli/zoph.ini.5.gz /usr/share/man/man5

CONFIGURATION CHANGES

The most important configuration change is the replacement of .zophrc and a part of config.inc.php by zoph.ini. You can use zoph.ini.example in the cli dir as an example.
