Zoph 0.8.2 to 0.8.2.1

Copy php/* to the location of your installation. Make sure to also copy the php/lang subdirectory.

You can upgrade directly from 0.8 or 0.8.1 to 0.8.2.1, simply use the zoph-0.8.2.1.tar.gz and execute the instructions for the 0.8 to 0.8.1 and 0.8.1 to 0.8.2 upgrade.

Zoph 0.8.1 to 0.8.2

 * You can use these instructions to go from 0.8.1.x to 0.8.2
 * If you want to upgrade from 0.8 or 0.8.0.x, first follow the upgrade instructions from 0.8 to 0.8.1 [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Zoph/Upgrading#Zoph_0.8_to_0.8.1]

As of 0.8.1, the bin and man directories in the Zoph tarball have been replaced by the cli directory. Also, zophExport.pl no longer exists and zophImport.pl has been replaced by zoph. If you had them installed, you should remove them from your system, they are no longer supported. Don't forget to remove the manpages (zophImport.pl.1.gz and zophExport.pl.1.gz) as well, they will usually be in /usr/share/man/man1.

Copy the contents of the php directory into your webroot and copy the lang directory into the webroot as well. You should make a backup copy of config.inc.php to prevent overwriting it.

	cp config.inc.php config.local.php
	cp -a php/* /var/www/html/zoph
	cp -a lang /var/www/html/zoph


Copy cli/zoph into /bin (or another directory in your $PATH).

	cp cli/zoph /bin

Copy zoph.1.gz into your man 1 directory (usually /usr/share/man/man1) and zoph.ini.5.gz into man 5 (usually /usr/share/man/man5).

	cp cli/zoph.1.gz /usr/share/man/man1
	cp cli/zoph.ini.5.gz /usr/share/man/man5

CONFIGURATION CHANGES

The most important configuration change is the replacement of .zophrc and a part of config.inc.php by zoph.ini. You can use zoph.ini.example in the cli dir as an example.

(see http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Zoph/Configuration for details)
