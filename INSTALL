Zoph 0.8 installation
9 Sept 2009

1. Requirements

   See the REQUIREMENTS document.

2. Creating the database

   2.1 Create a database and import the tables

       $ mysqladmin -u root -p create zoph
       $ mysql -u root -p zoph < sql/zoph.sql

   2.2 Create users for zoph

       I created two users: zoph_rw is used by the application and
       zoph_admin is used when I work directly in mysql so I don't
       have to use root.

       $ mysql -u root -p
       mysql> grant select, insert, update, delete on zoph.* to
zoph_rw@localhost identified by 'PASSWORD';

       mysql> grant all on zoph.* to zoph_admin identified by 'PASSWORD';

3. Configure the PHP templates

   The values to be configured are in the php/config.inc.php file.

   You will have to edit the following:

   - DB_HOST : your database host (localhost, for example)
   - DB_NAME : zoph (unless you used something else above)
   - DB_USER : zoph_rw, using the above example
   - DB_PASS : the password you set

   For more information, see http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Zoph/Configuration or the
   configuration.html in the docs directory.

4. Install the templates

   4.1 Pick a location to put Zoph

       Create a zoph/ directory off the doc root of your web server, or
       create a Virtual Host with a new doc root.

       $ mkdir /var/www/html/zoph

   4.2 Copy the templates

       $ cp -r php/* /var/www/html/zoph/

5. Install the perl scripts

   5.1 Check the path to perl

       The perl scripts points to /usr/bin/perl.  If your perl is
       in a different place, edit the first line of the script.

   5.2 Configure the database variables

       Edit zophrc.sample and store it as .zophrc in your homedir. Make sure that the
       following variables match the values you put in config.inc.php:

       $db_name = 'zoph';
       $db_user = 'zoph_rw';
       $db_pass = 'password';
       $image_dir = '/data/images' 

   5.3 Copy bin/zophImport.pl and bin/zophExport.pl to /usr/local/bin
       Or some other directory in your PATH.

   5.4 Install the man page
       A man page for zophImport.pl is in the man/ directory.  Copy this
       to somewhere in your manpath, /usr/local/man/man1 for example.

6. Test it

   Try hitting http://localhost/zoph/logon.php.  You should be presented
   with the logon screen.

   You can login with admin/admin. It is recommended to change this password.

   If you get a 404 error...
   + make sure the zoph/ folder and templates can be seen by the web
     server.

   If you see a bunch of code...
   + make sure Apache is configured to handle PHP (see the REQUIREMENTS
     file)

   If you see a MySQL access denied error...
   + make sure the DB_USER you specified in config.inc.php actually has
     access to the database.  If your database is not on localhost, you
     will need to grant permissions to zoph_rw@hostname for that host.
