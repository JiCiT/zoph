Zoph 0.8.2 installation
20/10/2010

1. Requirements

   See the REQUIREMENTS document.

2. Creating the database

   2.1 Create a database and import the tables

	$ mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE zoph CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci"
	$ mysql -u root -p zoph < sql/zoph.sql

   2.2 Create users for zoph

       I created two users: zoph_rw is used by the application and
       zoph_admin is used when I work directly in mysql so I don't
       have to use root.

       $ mysql -u root -p
       mysql> grant select, insert, update, delete on zoph.* to
zoph_rw@localhost identified by 'PASSWORD';

       mysql> grant all on zoph.* to zoph_admin identified by 'PASSWORD';

3. Create zoph.ini
   In Zoph 0.8.2 and later, you need to create a zoph.ini file, usually in 
   /etc. zoph.ini is where you define database settings. A simple example:

   [zoph]
   db_host = "localhost"
   db_name = "zoph"
   db_user = "zoph_rw"
   db_pass = "pass"
   db_prefix = "zoph_"

   php_location = /var/www/html/zoph

   An example zoph.ini file, called zoph.ini.example is included in the cli
   directory.
   See the man page for zoph.ini(5) or the Wikibooks documentation 
   [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Zoph/Configuration] for more details

4. Install the templates

   4.1 Pick a location to put Zoph

       Create a zoph/ directory off the doc root of your web server, or
       create a Virtual Host with a new doc root.

       $ mkdir /var/www/html/zoph

   4.2 Copy the templates

       $ cp -r php/* /var/www/html/zoph/

4. Configure the PHP templates

   Many configuration items can be set in php/config.inc.php file.
   For more information, see http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Zoph/Configuration.

5. Install the CLI scripts

   5.1 Check the path to PHP

       The CLI script points to /usr/bin/php.  If your PHP installation is
       in a different place, edit the first line of the script.

   5.2 Copy cli/zoph to /bin
       Or some other directory in your PATH.

   5.3 Install the man page
       Man pages for zoph and zoph.ini is in the cli/ directory. Copy these
       to the man1 and man5 directoies in your manpath, /usr/local/man/man1 and
       /usr/local/man/man5 for example.

6. Test it

   Try hitting http://localhost/zoph/logon.php.  You should be presented
   with the logon screen.

   You can log in with admin / admin. It is recommended to change this.

   If you get a 404 error...
   + make sure the zoph/ folder and templates can be seen by the web
     server.

   If you see a bunch of code...
   + make sure Apache is configured to handle PHP (see the REQUIREMENTS
     file)

   If you see a MySQL access denied error...
   + make sure the db_user you specified in zoph.ini actually has
     access to the database.  If your database is not on localhost, you
     will need to grant permissions to zoph_rw@hostname for that host.
