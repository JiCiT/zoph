REQUIREMENTS

Zoph is being developped on Linux, but it should be able to run on any OS that can run Apache, MySQL and PHP. Users have reported succesful installations on MacOSX, several BSD flavours and even Windows. Debian and Ubuntu users can install Zoph from apt by typing apt-get zoph.

Gentoo users could use the webapps overlay, although the version there is outdated.

Zoph requires the following:
    * Apache 2.2
    * PHP 5.2
    * MySQL 5.0
    * Perl 5.8.8
    * ImageMagick 6.5
    * Jhead 2.8x

Other versions may work as well, see below for more details. How to install these applications and get them to work together is depending on your OS and distribution. Check the documentation of the application and/or your distribution for details.
Contents

Apache
    * Current versions of Zoph are developped on Apache 2.2.x
          o 2.0.x probably works too, but is no longer tested.

PHP
    * Current versions of Zoph are developped on PHP 5.2
          o PHP 5.1 and 5.3 probably work too
          o PHP 6 has not yet been released and Zoph has not been tested against it.
          o PHP4 has been end of life since 31 December 2007. As of Zoph 0.8, PHP4 will no longer be supported by Zoph. Zoph 0.8.1 does not work with PHP4

  Required features
    * The following features (extensions) to PHP are required for Zoph. Not all distributions automatically install all of them.
          o session
          o mysql
          o pcre
          o gd2
          o exif
          o xml (Zoph >0.7)
          o pear (if you want to use the e-mail features)

  php.ini settings
    * If you are using the web importer you may need to increase the max_execution_time, upload_max_filesize, post_max_size and max_input_time in php.ini defined in php.ini. See MAX_UPLOAD on the Configuration page.
    * If you are using the watermarking feature, you probably need to increase the memory_limit setting. See WATERMARKING on the Configuration page.
    * The e-mail photo feature may require increasing the memory_limit setting. See EMAIL_PHOTOS on the Configuration page.

MySQL
    * Current versions are developped with MySQL 5.0
    * MySQL 5.1 should work too
    * MySQL 4.0 and 4.1 may still work but are no longer supported.

Perl
The commandline interface of Zoph (zophImport.pl and zophExport.pl) is written in Perl. If you do not intend to use it, you can skip this paragraph.
    * Zoph is developped in Perl 5.8.8
          o Zoph has not been tested against 5.9.x or 5.10.x because my distribution (Gentoo) still hasn't incorporated them.
    * The following Perl modules are required for Zoph to run
          o Perl DBI, DBD::mysql, File::stat, Image::Size,
          o Perl File::Spec::Link (Zoph >v0.7)
    * You may already have the DBI, DBD::mysql and File::stat but you probably have to install the Image::Size package. You can use CPAN to do this. (Note that the first time you run CPAN you'll have to answer some questions. You can just go with the defaults until you are asked to choose the hosts).
$ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Image::Size'
    * If needed, install the other Perl packages as above.

ImageMagick
    * Current Zoph versions have been tested against ImageMagick 6.5.x

Jhead
    * Jhead 2.8x
          o Other versions probably work as well

Jhead is a handy little program that extracts the information stored in the Exif headers that are added by most digital cameras. Exif stores date and time plus a bunch of other info about a photo. Zoph uses Jhead to parse the header so you'll need to install it. You can download it from http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/.

Browser
In order to be able to use Zoph, you will need a browser.
    * Zoph is being developped and thoroughly tested with Firefox 3.x.
    * Zoph should work with all recent browser versions
          o Please report a bug if it doesn't.
    * Older versions usually work, but layout may not be 100% ok.
    * Some features require Javascript support
          o You can turn off Javascript support in Zoph with the JAVASCRIPT configuration setting. Obviously features that require it will be disabled as well.
          o Zoph should work when Javascript is turned off in the browser, except if the Autocomplete feature is enabled, however, Zoph will detect this and warn the user to turn Autocompletion off (or Javascript on).
