<P>
This document is meant to help you install all the packages required by
Zoph.  I've gotten everything running on Linux (Debian and Mandrake) and
Mac OS X without too much trouble and people have reported getting Zoph
to work under Windows as well.  You might be able to skip this if you
know your way around your system.

<H2><A NAME="section-1.1.">1. What You Need</A></H2>

<P>
You need to have the following installed before running Zoph.<BR>
Version numbers are what I have tested with, I expect any recent
versions would work:

<UL>
  <LI>MySQL 3.23
  <LI>Apache 1.3.9
  <LI>PHP 4.0.4
  <LI>Perl 5.6
  <LI>Perl DBI, DBD::mysql, Image::Size
  <LI>ImageMagick 5.3
  <LI>Jhead 1.2

</UL>
<P>
You probably already have many of these.  Getting most of them is fairly
simple.  For example, using Debian you can simply:

<P>
<code>$ apt-get update<BR></code>
<code>$ apt-get install perl apache php4 mysql-server php4-mysql imagemagick jhead</code>

<P>
If you are planning on using the web based importer you may need to install
the GD 2 library for image support in PHP (<A HREF="http://www.boutell.com/gd/">http://www.boutell.com/gd/</A>).  A
Debian package named php4-gd2 is available.  Also, you may need to upgrade
to PHP 4.2 if you want EXIF support.  GD is required to use the importer.
PHP 4.2 is recommended but not required.

<P>
Also, if you are using the web importer you may need to increase the
max_execution_time defined in php.ini.  There is more info in the MANUAL.

<H2><A NAME="section-1.2.">2. Apache &amp; PHP</A></H2>

<P>
You may have to edit your httpd.conf file to add PHP support.  Edit
/var/apache/conf/httpd.conf (or the equivalent) and uncomment/add
these lines:

<P>
LoadModule php4_module /usr/lib/apache/1.3/libphp4.so<BR>
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php<BR>
AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

<P>
Save the file and restart apache:

<P>
<code>$ apachectl restart</code>

<P>
Put a php file in your webserver's path to test things out:<BR>
<code>$ cat /var/www/test.php <BR></code>
&lt;?  echo phpinfo(); ?&gt;

<P>
Hit <A HREF="http://localhost/test.php">http://localhost/test.php</A> and you should see info about your PHP version.

<H2><A NAME="section-1.3.">3. MySQL</A></H2>

<P>
If MySQL is not up and running you'll need to start it:

<P>
<code>$ /etc/init.d/mysql start</code>

<P>
If you haven't set your root password, do it!

<P>
<code>$ mysqladmin -u root password &lt;password&gt;</code>

<H2><A NAME="section-1.4.">4. Perl Packages</A></H2>

<P>
You may already have the DBI and DBD::mysql but you probably have to
install the Image::Size package.  You can use CPAN to do this.  (Note
that the first time you run CPAN you'll have to answer some questions.
You can just go with the defaults until you are asked to choose the
hosts).

<P>
<code>$ perl -MCPAN -e 'install Image::Size'</code>

<P>
If needed, install the other Perl packages as above.

<H2><A NAME="section-1.5.">5. Jhead</A></H2>

<P>
Jhead is a handy little program that extracts the information stored in
the Exif headers that are added by most digital cameras.  Exif stores
date and time plus a bunch of other info about a photo.  Zoph uses
Jhead to parse the header so you'll need to install it.  You can
download it from:
