<H2><A NAME="section-1.1.">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>
   Zoph (Zoph Organizes PHotos) is a web based photo management system
   written using PHP and backed by MySQL.  Photos are loaded to the db
   using a perl script or a web interface.

<P>
   After I bought a digital camera I wanted some way to easily organize
   a growing number of photos.  I've worked on Zoph off and on over the
   last couple of years and have used it to store and cross reference
   a few thousand of my photos.

   Yes, there are tons of photo album projects it seems.  What makes Zoph
   different?  Well, here are some of it's features:

<UL>
  <LI>Photos can have lots of meta data.  Each photo record can store:
  <UL>
    <LI>EXIF info (date, time, width, height, size,
       camera make, camera model, flash used, focal length,
       exposure, aperture, etc)
    <LI>title
    <LI>photographer
    <LI>location
    <LI>description
    <LI>rating
    <LI>people in the photo
  </UL>
  <LI>Each photo can appear in zero or more albums.
  <LI>Each photo can appear in zero or more categories.
  <LI>Albums and categories are both hierarchical.
  <LI>Searches can be performed using all this data:
     "Show me all photos taken by 'Joe Smith' between 2001-01-01 and
      2001-12-31 at 'Joe and Nancy's House' in which 'Nancy Smith'
      appears and whose rating is greater than 5".
  <LI>Access privileges:
  <UL>
    <LI>each user has an account and is granted permissions on albums
    <LI>each user can specify preferences, including a color scheme
    <LI>an automatically logged in guest user can be defined.
  </UL>
  <LI>Slideshows.
  <LI>Lightboxes.
  <LI>"Email this photo" feature.
  <LI>Basic reporting: most photographed people, places, etc.
  <LI>Photos, albums, categories, people, places and users can be
     easily administered using the web interface.
  <LI>Import photos from the web or by using a Perl script.
